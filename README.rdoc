This app is meant to control a “MarchMadness” style tournament, though the details of the underlying tournament are not intended to remain relevant. It provides for an administrative user who invites the participants through an email (though the content of the message is fixed). The participants create a Bracket, which when compared to the Result managed by the Admin, produces a ranked score among the participants. Many other features are planned.

The scoring system, the type of bracket being predicted by the players, and several other details will eventually be customizable.

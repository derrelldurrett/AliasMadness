admin(auto-delete?) of sad-sack players (those what ain't paid)
slimmed down game updates using ActionCable to do auto updates for players who are logged in
    pub-sub for saving the games
        a game has a channel (a la users subscribing to messages that are for them directly)
        it subscribes to that channel while brackets are unlocked
        when it gets a "new subscription" message, it subscribes to the channel for the admin's game w/same label

        changing a game sends the new winner as a message to server

        one channel per game (or per bracket? this would reduce the number of channels)
    after brackets are locked, players subscribe to the admin's game (or bracket?) to get updates when they are changed
figure out if a machine-learning technique can improve scenario computation run-time
right-click on a player in the left column to directly compare future chances
calculate "potential points" remaining for a bracket
show "potential (or final, as appropriate) point/original potential points"

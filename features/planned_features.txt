admin(auto-delete?) of sad-sack players (those what ain't paid)
admin can see/show possible futures scenarios for wins/losses
    Only do this after the first two rounds are complete (no need to risk a stack explosion)
    Store the scenarios in a table
    Group the presentation in a useful way
        A typical situation spanning multiple "scenarios" is one where the winner is determined with
            more than one game remaining
        Or, stated differently, many different scenarios result in no change in the outcome
        So, "group" the scenarios by indicating the common result among them and show that final result?
right-click on a player in the left column to directly compare future chances
calculate "potential points" remaining for a bracket
show "potential (or final, as appropriate) point/original potential points"
